Pharmacy Management System  

Project Overview  
The Pharmacy Management System is a Python-based application designed to streamline the management of pharmacy operations. This system provides a user-friendly interface to handle medicine inventory, sales records, and generate reports. It aims to assist pharmacies in automating their daily tasks, reducing errors, and improving operational efficiency.  

Key Features  
- Medicine Inventory Management: Add, update, and delete medicine details efficiently.  
- Sales Tracking: Maintain detailed records of all sales transactions for easy reference.  
- Backup System: Ensures data safety with automated backups of inventory and sales records.  
- Comprehensive Reports: Generates detailed sales reports for performance tracking.  
- User-Friendly GUI: Simplified interface built with Python's Tkinter library.  

Technical Highlights  
Core Functionality:  
  - Add new medicines and update existing entries in the database.  
  - Record and retrieve sales transactions.  
  - Backup and restore inventory and sales data.  
Dataset:  
  - Medicine Database: Contains details of medicines such as name, category, price, and stock levels.  
  - Sales Records: Logs sales data, including medicine sold, quantity, and transaction details.  
Technologies Used:  
  - Python for application logic and GUI.  
  - CSV files for database storage and easy manipulation.
